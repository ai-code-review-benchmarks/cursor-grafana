# Breaking changes in Grafana v12.0

Following are breaking changes that you should be aware of when upgrading to Grafana v12.0.

For our purposes, a breaking change is any change that requires users or operators to do something. This includes:

- Changes in one part of the system that could cause other components to fail
- Deprecations or removal of a feature
- Changes to an API that could break automation
- Changes that affect some plugins or functions of Grafana
- Migrations that can’t be rolled back

For each change, the provided information:

- Helps you determine if you’re affected
- Describes the change or relevant background information
- Guides you in how to mitigate for the change or migrate
- Provides more learning resources

For release highlights and deprecations, refer to our [v12.0 What’s new](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v12-0/). For the specific steps we recommend when you upgrade to v12.0, check out our [Upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/upgrade-guide/upgrade-v12.0/).
